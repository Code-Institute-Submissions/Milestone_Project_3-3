# Recipe Pot Website

- This is a recipe website that users can use to find, save, and share recipes. Recipe Pot is a platform where users can search through a wide range of recipes
that they can view, and follow to re-create the same dish. Some of the main functionalities of this website are:
    - Search Bar.
    - Register option.
    - Login option.
    - Logout option.
    - Save recipes you like to your profile account.
    - Post recipes that you and other users of the website can use.
    - Contact form

 - A more detailed description of website functionalities can be found in the sections below.

## UX
- Strategy plane:
    - I aim to build an online recipe book platform that will give users a place where they can search, share, and save recipes of their favorite dish. 
 
    - As someone who is looking to find his next dish to cook, I want to use the website to find new recipes.
    - As a user of the Recipe Pot website, I want to be able to search for more recipes and go through them with ease. 
    - As a user of the Recipe Pot website, I want to have an insight into what ingredients different recipes will require me to have to re-create the same dish.
    - As a user of the Recipe Pot website, I want to be able to save my favorite recipes, for future use, to my profile account I have created on this platform.
    - As a user of the Recipe Pot website, I want to be able to share some of my favorite dish recipes on this website that other users can view.
    - As a user of the Recipe Pot website, I would like to contact the website admin in case I have any questions.
 
- Scope plane:
    - Users should be able to search for recipes using the search bar.
    - There should be detailed information about each recipe, displayed consistently so that information pattern can easily be recognized by the first time user. 
    - A form like structure should be used that will allow the user to input information about the dish he/she would like to share.
    - There should be a "Contact Us" page that can be used in case the user has any questions or would like to contact the admin of the page.
 
- Structure plane:
    - User Interface:
        - It should be simple to use, adhering to the 'rule of thumb' keeping everything on less than 3 clicks away.
        - Users can search for recipes, and food types using two input fields, select field, and a search bar.
        - Register service will provide the users with additional options, they will allow the user to personalize his use of the website by allowing him to share and save recipes. 
 
- Skeleton plane:
    - There should always be a menu or exit button available so that users can have the freedom to navigate between different pages.
    - Information content:
        - Recipes adhere to the same display format, each having the same pattern in which information is delivered.
        - Clear and easy to use a landing page.
 
- Structure plane:
    - The color theme for this project will be generated using the following color palette generator [Coolors](https://coolors.co).
    - The design should be kept simple, clear, and easy to understand. It should not be overcrowded with unnecessary information as this can confuse the first time user. 
    - Animations should be used where necessary making the website more interactive and more appealing to the user's eye.
